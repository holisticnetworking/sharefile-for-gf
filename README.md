Description
===========
For developers seeking to utilize Citrix ShareFile's highly-secure uploading, this plugin will allow users to upload files to a folder specified by the administrator of the site.  

**Note that this plugin was developed with a specific set of needs in mind. Your mileage may vary, but I'm perfectly willing to extend the feature set for those who request it.**  

You _must_ have Gravity Forms installed on your site in order for this plugin to function correctly.

Installation
============
Simply go to Plugins > Add New and search for ShareFile for Gravity Forms. Install the plugin and head over to Gravity Forms > Settings > ShareFile Settings. You'll need to get your ShareFile API key, including the Client ID and Secret, in order to proceed.
